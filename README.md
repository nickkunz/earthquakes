This brief data visualization study was conducted for earthquake activity detected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) on October 10, 2017.

This work was completed in partial fulfillment for the course Data Mining the City at Columbia University GSAPP in 2017.

The code is written in Python and intended for execution on the Processing 3 IDE, which can be downloaded at https://www.processing.org/download/. Ensure that the Python mode is installed an enbaled (Java is enabled by default). Also, ensure that the .csv data is placed in the same file path as the .pyde file. Enjoy!
